I added a dialogue/interaction blueprint function so that if you go in front of a sign or anything and press ‘X’ a dialogue box appears. When you go away from it, the or press ‘X’ again, the dialogue box disappears. 

We might also want to make something that shows 'press X' or something when you get in front of objects that can be interacted with. I can work on that next. - SOCKI 10/18/2020
